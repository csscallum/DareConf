We're all fish out of water: how to face work anxiety by making real connections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> A lot of us feel like frauds in the work we do, even though we seem accomplished and capable from the outside. Likewise, many of us feel like our work itself is fraudulent or lacks value, because it doesn't feel integral to who we are. In this session, Elizabeth shows how these feelings are exacerbated by workplace stress and bureaucracy, but can be overcome. 

**Imposter Syndrome - do we really all have it?** It's a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalise their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved.

Elizabeth felt she was at 'Next level' imposter syndrome: "I know I'm good at it, I go in as consultant to sort content issues and it can be therapeutic for the company." But she felt the work she was doing didn't have value. Even though she was helping people, she felt could never help enough. There were too many deep-seated issues in the businesses which she could never deal with. Despair in the business resulted in despair in herself.

**Is the idea that work should feel valuable an utopian fantasy?** In the modern world we feel we should have value in what we do but that wasn't the case a couple of generations ago. In the design world we read articles about people experiencing this value, so we compare ourselves to them. However modern life is rubbish! We're working in offices all day, which humans aren't designed to do. Having a nice environment is nice but still isn't natural.

### Story Telling

Elizabeth is a story teller. She was telling herself her life was a novel and she should have known where it should have been going. She thought she was the author. By having this novelistic view of life, it made life more depressing than it was. By telling her life as a story she felt she was losing touch of the good moments at each time. Instead, think of life as a collection of short stories, not a novel from start to finish and don't try and judge where you are on this huge trajectory from birth to death.

### Have a mentor, be a mentor

Elizabeth's mentors just happened, they weren't superiors who get you promotions and move you up. They were cranks, didn't bullshit, were on other paths. Taught her it was OK to be a crank, to complain about things, **complain more**. If you can find people you emotionally connect with they teach you things that stick.

Learn from your friends. Jealousy of other people is a great motivator as they inspire you to achieve more.

Fear is normal and it's telling you something. Don't ignore it and don't try to not feel bad about things.

Nothing is ever perfect, and if you think something is, it isn't when you get there. If you stop trying to be perfect it expands your horizon. You can be un-perfect at so many more things than you can be perfect at.
