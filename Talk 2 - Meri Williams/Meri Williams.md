Stealing from sports: really useful coaching
--------------------------------------------

> We can learn a lot from sports coaching, where the most effective coaches aren't the most talented players. How does a coach help an athlete who's an expert in the actual practice of the sport to perform better? And how can we apply the same techniques to our own work? 

The best coaches aren't necessarily the best players and sometimes great players are terrible coaches. This tells us someone can coach you to perform better, even if they are less expert than you.

> Misconception: REAL experts are those who can *explain* what know. Truth: Real experts CAN'T explain the most crucial things they *know*

### Sat-Nav vs A Map & Compass

Satellite Navigation guides the user step-by-step to a destination with no user initiative or skill requirement. A map and compass requires the user to solve issues and create their own solution or route. Satellite Navigation represents Micromanagement whereas a map and compass represents 'Train to do'.

**A mentor** is someone with more experience either generally or in a specific area, who can give you advice. Often on big, long term topics.
**A coach** is someone who is helping you to find the best way forward based on what you *already know*. Usually more immediate focus.

### Coaching

The first coaching conversations can be disconcerting and frustrating. The trainee may well turn round and say "just tell me what I should do, as this is really frustrating!". The goal is to empower the trainee to resist asking "What should I do?" and instead propose "Here's what we could do".

The GROW model is a technique for problem solving or goal setting. The particular value of GROW is that it provides an effective, structured methodology which both helps set goals effectively and is a problem solving process.

<dl>
    <dt>**Goal**</dt>
    <dd>All too often people jump in and say "I think you should do this" which makes people come back to you for answers in future. This is where the trainee wants to be at the end, or what is to be achieved. </dd>
    <dt>**Reality**</dt>
    <dd>This is where the trainee currently stands in terms of their skills and experience. Based on this; what are the issues, the challenges, how far are they away from their goal?</dd>
    <dt>**Options**</dt>
    <dd>How can we solve this?</dd>
    <dt>**Will**</dt>
    <dd>What are you going to do before we next meet? Unlike in mentoring, advice is given freely but it's up to the coach how far they go with this.</dd>

You don't need to know much to be an effective coach. The structured conversation draws out what they already know. For example: "The real problem is talking to this person makes me really uncomfortable" - so fix it by going down the pub with them, it's not all about work.

You can buddy up and coach each other too - often a great solution! Set aside time where you can discuss things together, maybe at a caf√© or over some lunch once a month.
